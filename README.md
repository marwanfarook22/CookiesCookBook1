# 🔄 LINQ Refactoring Project - README 📄

🍪 Project Description
This project is a refactoring exercise for the Cookie Cookbook application, focusing on replacing traditional loop-based code with LINQ (Language Integrated Query) methods. The goal is to make the code more:

✅ Concise

✅ Readable

✅ Functional

✅ Maintainable

***

✨ Key Benefits ✨

Simplifies collection operations

Reduces boilerplate code

Improves code expressiveness

Makes developer intentions clearer
***
🛠️ Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CookieCookbook
```
Restore dependencies:
````bash
dotnet restore
````
Build the project:

```bash
dotnet build
```
Run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```
***
� SOLID Principles Applied
Principle	🎯 How It's Applied
Single Responsibility (SRP)	Each LINQ query does one thing
Open/Closed (OCP)	Easy to extend with new LINQ operations
Liskov Substitution (LSP)	Works consistently across all IEnumerable types
Interface Segregation (ISP)	Uses minimal IEnumerable<T> interface
Dependency Inversion (DIP)	Works with abstractions, not concrete types
🏗️ Design Patterns Used
🔄 Functional Patterns
Select (Map)

Where (Filter)

Aggregate (Reduce)
***
♻️ Iterator Pattern
LINQ leverages .NET's built-in iterators
 
🎨 Decorator Pattern
Method chaining adds behavior step-by-step

⚙️ Strategy Pattern
Lambdas act as interchangeable query strategies
***
🔧 Refactoring Approach
🔄 Replace foreach loops with LINQ methods

🧩 Use method syntax for clarity

🧪 Maintain identical functionality

⚡ Keep code testable and clean

✅ Verification Checklist
🧪 All unit tests pass

� Application behaves exactly as before

⏱️ Performance remains acceptable
